# Alphadraft

This is the first version of my Programm, which hopefully become a helpfull tool to predict the outcome of a single Gameday of mainly the EU LCS. However, its planed, that this programm also can be used for both NA LCS and LCK (just didn't find a proper way to implement the possibility of a 3rd game).

The scoring used is the one www.Alphadraft.com (as the name probably implies) uses.

Its planned, to use QT for the graphical interface, so at a point, this toolkit will be required to build the Programm.
